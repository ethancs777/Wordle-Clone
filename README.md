# Wordle

Works just like the famous New York Times game Wordle. The user gets 6 guesses at a 5 letter word. Gray means the letter was not in the word. Yellow means the letter is in the word but not in the right position. Green means the letter is in the word and in the right position.

To run this program you will need to pull this repository to a local folder. Then run the following commands:
## npm install
## npm run dev

This will launch a local developer environment (assuming Node.js is installed), just open the localhost link provided in the terminal to view the live page.
